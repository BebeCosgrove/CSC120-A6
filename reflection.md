I used this on line 120 of Library.java for printCollection. I used this to understand how to print out the keys in the hashtable by using keySet to get a set of the keys and then I iterated over these with a for loop.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It was a little confusing at first with the constructor but I figured it out eventually and now I understand it.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Definitely looking up how to use certain methods for hashtables and other things was very helpful in utilizing the methods needed to do what I needed to do. I would tell someone to really think of what each method needs to check and know(like if a book is already in the library or something).
